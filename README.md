# create_a_tableau_story
The objective of this project is to create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Pre-Requisites
- You need to install Tableau. You can download the free-public version [here.](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/)
- Choose a data set from the [Data Set Options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true) document or find a data set to explore and visualize. 

## Getting Started
- First make sure you have Tableau installed and you have downloaded a data set.
- Start up Tableau, in the left sidebar you'll see the data sources you can connect to. For file sources, you can connect to an Excel file, a text file such as a CSV, or statistical files such as from SAS, SPSS, and R.
- Click the option that matches the type file you chose and browse through your files to select it.

## Final version of the visualization:
This is my final product.
